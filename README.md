# Mucski's REDBOT V3 Cogs.

How to install my cogs? You can fork this github or just use it as it is

[prefix]repo add Mucski https://github.com/mucski/mucski

The Paladins COG requires your own Developer ID and API Key which you can grab from here: https://fs12.formsite.com/HiRez/form48/secure_index.html

Coins/Potato - are small idle games.

Hunting is part of AIKATERNA cogs ... I just added a few options for myself for my own amusement ... I'd suggest you use AIKA's cog instead which is regularly updated.
